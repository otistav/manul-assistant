# Personal assistant (Manul) for my needs.
![this is cool Manul](./assets/manul-logo-with-white-stroke.png)
Originally, I thought to make it in go, but since I need it asap, I decided to make it in node.

# What it does
1. Bunch of CLI commands which goes like:
```
manul *name of the command*
```
2. Telegram integration for useful stuff (for example, reminders)
# TODO

1. ~~Create telegram script which sends wiki potd every morning~~
2. Create proper project structure
3. Start test coverage.
4. Write cron scripts in separate folder
5. **URGENT** Make cli work with typescript
